## Immutable Blog

*(ongoing experiment)*

An experiment to showcase a microblog built on top of Ethereum network where authors can make small posts with textual content or images.
- Images are stored using the IPFS system.
- The visual interface (pending) will be built using ReactJs.
- Content will be queried from the network by the browser, without any backend
